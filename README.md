### Description

SPEAK- Speak is a Personlised English Accent Kernel - A chatterbot - Chat with the computer.

Speak is a Personlised English Accent Kernel. It is still in beta stage. It is a chatterbot whhich can chat in English with you. It is very dumber when you start chatting with it for the first time, but gradually it will develop it's knowledge. You can personalise it by talking with it about you. Please mail me your 'mem.dat'(memory file) after you have chatted with it for a long time so that I can fuse all the collected mem.dat file into one big file hence improving the knowledge of SPEAK. Comments, improvements, credits, feedback and votes are greatly appreciated.
